## Background

The tool was created as a means to quickly and easily experiment with EOSIO on mac or linux.



1. Install EOSIO (dawn_v4.0.0) in the `~/eos` directory
2. Edit nodeos config.ini to include the following entries:
			# Enable production on a stale chain, since a single-node test chain is pretty much always stale
			enable-stale-production = true
			# Enable block production with the testnet producers
			producer-name = eosio
			# Load the block producer plugin, so you can produce blocks
			plugin = eosio::producer_plugin
			# Wallet plugin
			plugin = eosio::wallet_api_plugin
			# As well as API and HTTP plugins
			plugin = eosio::chain_api_plugin
			plugin = eosio::http_plugin
			# This will be used by the validation step below, to view account history
			plugin = eosio::account_history_api_plugin
			# print contract's output to console (eosio::chain_plugin)
			contracts-console = true		
			# Append the error log to HTTP responses (eosio::http_plugin)
			verbose-http-errors = true
3. Python3

## Contribute

If you are interested in contributing, please read [the code of conduct file](code-of-conduct.md).

PRs are accepted, but be aware that the tool currently meets our very limited needs and so our time to review is limited. We decided to share it with the open source community in the hopes that it would be as useful for others as it has been for us. You are encouraged to fork it and make a go of it on your own. Having said that, we would love to hear from you aboout your efforts! If we can help we will!

Small note: If editing the README, please conform to the [standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme) specification.
